"Humanities - Hist & Phil, and Cultural Studies - US Minority course.Topic: Caribbean Latino Migrations Description: From the aftermath of Hurricane Maria to the global hit-song ""Despacito"" andthose who star in baseball, the Caribbean Latino presence in U.S. society surrounds us. This course is geared toward developinga historical understanding about Caribbean Latinos in the United States. Through course materials, class discussions, and lectureswe explore the political and cultural relationships established between the U.S. and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, the processof community building for Cubans, Puerto Ricans, and Dominicans in the U.S. as well as transnationally, and how CaribbeanLatinos reconcile their place in the United States with their historical pasts. Individual and group exercises along with writtenassignments will be used to accomplish the course's major aims: to further develop our ability to think critically, write analytically, andto understand U.S. Caribbean Latinos in a historically nuanced manner. Graded assignments will consist of response papers, a 5-7page critical essay, and exams.",,,,,,
